SavvyShapes is an auto-timetabler built on Google App Engine. It is designed to be used when you are enrolling for uni courses (primarily UNSW). SavvyShapes attempts to find a combination of classes that is most convenient for you based on your own preferences.

Computation is client-side in Javascript, only course scraping and timetable saving requires GAE.
